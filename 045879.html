When are these instances being deprecated?\n- We will be grouping the migration of RDS for MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL database instances running on M4, R4, or T2 instance types into two rounds.\n- Accounts that do not have associated reserved instances start from June 1, 2024.\n- Accounts with associated reserved instances start from September 1, 2024.\n\nQ. Which instance type(s) will my database be auto-migrated to?\n- We will make our best effort to migrate your database instance from M4\u2192M5, R4\u2192R5 and T2\u2192T3 and keep its original sizes.\n- In cases that we cannot keep the original size, we will attempt to migrate your database instance to one size smaller than its original size. We have only identified M4.10xlarge as having no equivalent size and will migrate that to M5.8xlarge. Reserved instances (RIs) associated with M4.10xlarge will be cancelled after we have migrated that account\u2019s M4.10xlarge DB instance to M5.8xlarge.\n- The upgraded instance types are generally less expensive than the older generation instance types, but there are some cases that may cause an increase to your monthly bill. For the most up-to-date prices, please refer to Amazon Relational Database Service pricing page [6].\n\nQ. Do I have to be on a particular engine version to be auto-migrated?\n- We have removed requirements to be on a particular engine version. If your database is on a M4/R4/T2 instance types, we will try to upgrade them.\n\nQ. What can I expect when my database instance upgrade?\n- For accounts without active RDS MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL M4, R4, or T2 reserved instances, starting June 1, 2024, RDS will set a parameter to \u2018modify RDS MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL M4/R4/T2 DB instances to M5/R5/T3\u2019.\n- The database instance will update during your scheduled maintenance period. If by chance your database instance is still on M4, R4 or T2 instances following your scheduled maintenance period, on our second attempt, we will directly apply the changes.\n- For more information on how DB instances are modified, please see Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance [4].\n\nQ. How will Reserved Instance (RI) migration work with DB instance upgrade?\n- The RI migration and DB instance upgrade are two separate processes that run after one another. RDS will work through each region and find all M4/R4/T2 RI contracts and create corresponding M5/R5/T3 RI contracts. Then RDS will work through each region and find all M4/R4/T2 DB instances and insert an action to \u201cmodify\u201d the instance type. During your maintenance window, the M4/R4/T2 DB instances will update to a M5/R5/T3 DB instance. After all DB instances are updated, we will cancel the old M4/R4/T2 RI contracts.\n\nQ. When is the exact date of my auto-upgrade?\n- Due to a large number of instances that require an upgrade, we are not able to provide a date when your upgrade will happen.\n\nQ. What if I have RIs covering my databases and it expires before my auto-migration happens?\n- You will incur some on-demand charges until you purchase the RI to cover the database instance.\n- If your RIs expire and you have not been auto-upgraded, we recommend you to self-upgrade your database(s) and purchase RIs to cover your upgraded database(s).\n\nQ. Will there be a downtime? If Yes, how long?\n- Yes, there will be some downtime. Downtime will depend on the size of a customer's instance/database. It can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 60 minutes, but typically less than 30 minutes. If a customer configured their instances as Multi-AZ, each database instance will be down one at a time.\n\nQ. What if I want to self-upgrade my database instances but I am not sure how to?\n- For help migrating your Amazon RDS instances to an alternate AZ, please refer to the 'How do I move an Amazon RDS instance out of an Availability Zone?' re:Post article [2].\n- You may consider using RDS Blue Green Deployments [3] for RDS MySQL and RDS PostgreSQL to seamlessly upgrade your database's instance type or engine version.\n- Directly change your DB instance type by Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance [4].\n\nQ. My engine version needs to be upgraded; can I upgrade both on my own?\n- You may upgrade both the engine version and instance type at the same time. Directly change your DB instance type by Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance [4]. For additional details, refer to AWS CLI command reference modify-db-instance options parameter \u2018db-instance-class\u2019 and \u2018engine-version\u2019 [5].\n\nQ. Will the RI upgrade process cause additional RI charges?\n- To continue to provide RDS reserved instance (RI) discount on the old and new DB instance types during your DB instance migration, our RI migration process creates a RI of the new DB instance type matching your old DB instance RI contract term with the public rate of the new instance type. During your upgrade month, you will see an extra RI line item on your billing report, one RI for the old instance type and one RI for the new instance type. However, only one of the RIs will incur a positive hourly fee at the listed public rates, if applicable, at any one time. After we migrate your DB instance, we will cancel the old DB instance type RI contract, leaving only the new DB instance type RI contract that charges at the relevant public rate.\n- RDS RI public rates are found on Amazon Relational Database Service pricing page [6].\n\n[1] https://aws.amazon.com/support\n[2] https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/rds-move-availability-zone\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments.html\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html\n[6] https://aws.amazon.com/rds/pricing/"}, "endTime": null, "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-19 03:52:20.628000+02:00", "region": "eu-west-1", "service": "RDS", "startTime": "1717138800", "statusCode": "open"}, {"AccountName": "NVSGISRSA.GB", "AffectedResources": "arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:128010802554:db:f1portalprd01", "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:eu-west-1::event/RDS/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_6232bbc261bb557a3f318c3b420a7fd15e922a2e8a67c854e42bf36ae58446d7", "awsAccountId": "128010802554", "description": {"latestDescription": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication.]\n\nYou can disregard this notification if you no longer have Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL database instances running on M4, R4, and T2 instance types.\n\nWe have identified one or more Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL database instances running on M4, R4, and T2 instance types.

Directly change your DB instance type by Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance [4]. For additional details, refer to AWS CLI command reference modify-db-instance options parameter \u2018db-instance-class\u2019 and \u2018engine-version\u2019 [5].\n\nQ. Will the RI upgrade process cause additional RI charges?\n- To continue to provide RDS reserved instance (RI) discount on the old and new DB instance types during your DB instance migration, our RI migration process creates a RI of the new DB instance type matching your old DB instance RI contract term with the public rate of the new instance type. During your upgrade month, you will see an extra RI line item on your billing report, one RI for the old instance type and one RI for the new instance type. However, only one of the RIs will incur a positive hourly fee at the listed public rates, if applicable, at any one time. After we migrate your DB instance, we will cancel the old DB instance type RI contract, leaving only the new DB instance type RI contract that charges at the relevant public rate.\n- RDS RI public rates are found on Amazon Relational Database Service pricing page [6].\n\n[1] https://aws.amazon.com/support\n[2] https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/rds-move-availability-zone\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments.html\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html\n[6] https://aws.amazon.com/rds/pricing/"}, "endTime": null, "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-19 03:52:20.628000+02:00", "region": "eu-west-1", "service": "RDS", "startTime": "1717138800", "statusCode": "open"}, {"AccountName": "NOVARTIS-RDRAR02.PGB", "AffectedResources": ["arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:379539495834:db:grafana-493251567168"], "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:eu-west-1::event/RDS/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_6232bbc261bb557a3f318c3b420a7fd15e922a2e8a67c854e42bf36ae58446d7", "awsAccountId": "379539495834", "description": {"latestDescription": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication.]\n\nYou can disregard this notification if you no longer have Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL database instances running on M4, R4, and T2 instance types.\n\nWe have identified one or more Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL database instances running on M4, R4, and T2 instance types.

What can I expect when my database instance upgrade?\n- For accounts without active RDS MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL M4, R4, or T2 reserved instances, starting June 1, 2024, RDS will set a parameter to \u2018modify RDS MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL M4/R4/T2 DB instances to M5/R5/T3\u2019.\n- The database instance will update during your scheduled maintenance period. If by chance your database instance is still on M4, R4 or T2 instances following your scheduled maintenance period, on our second attempt, we will directly apply the changes.\n- For more information on how DB instances are modified, please see Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance [4].\n\nQ. How will Reserved Instance (RI) migration work with DB instance upgrade?\n- The RI migration and DB instance upgrade are two separate processes that run after one another. RDS will work through each region and find all M4/R4/T2 RI contracts and create corresponding M5/R5/T3 RI contracts. Then RDS will work through each region and find all M4/R4/T2 DB instances and insert an action to \u201cmodify\u201d the instance type. During your maintenance window, the M4/R4/T2 DB instances will update to a M5/R5/T3 DB instance. After all DB instances are updated, we will cancel the old M4/R4/T2 RI contracts.\n\nQ. When is the exact date of my auto-upgrade?\n- Due to a large number of instances that require an upgrade, we are not able to provide a date when your upgrade will happen.\n\nQ. What if I have RIs covering my databases and it expires before my auto-migration happens?\n- You will incur some on-demand charges until you purchase the RI to cover the database instance.\n- If your RIs expire and you have not been auto-upgraded, we recommend you to self-upgrade your database(s) and purchase RIs to cover your upgraded database(s).\n\nQ. Will there be a downtime? If Yes, how long?\n- Yes, there will be some downtime. Downtime will depend on the size of a customer's instance/database. It can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 60 minutes, but typically less than 30 minutes. If a customer configured their instances as Multi-AZ, each database instance will be down one at a time.\n\nQ.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home"}, "endTime": null, "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-03 08:39:29.719000+02:00", "region": "eu-west-1", "service": "RDS", "startTime": "1724310000", "statusCode": "upcoming"}, {"AccountName": "NVSGISRSA.GB", "AffectedResources": "arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:128010802554:db:databricksprd02-eu-west-1b", "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:eu-west-1::event/RDS/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_ff68ef5fa78dd18d71ad094b7f088d03f64b683700cfca15c99c49c439e33105", "awsAccountId": "128010802554", "description": {"latestDescription": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication if resources remain unresolved.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.\n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration.

For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home"}, "endTime": null, "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-15 06:00:14.321000+02:00", "region": "eu-west-1", "service": "RDS", "startTime": "1724310000", "statusCode": "upcoming"}, {"AccountName": "NVSGISRSA.GB", "AffectedResources": "arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:128010802554:db:idqf1qa01", "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:eu-west-1::event/RDS/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_ff68ef5fa78dd18d71ad094b7f088d03f64b683700cfca15c99c49c439e33105", "awsAccountId": "128010802554", "description": {"latestDescription": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication if resources remain unresolved.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.\n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home"}, "endTime": null, "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-15 06:00:14.321000+02:00", "region": "eu-west-1", "service": "RDS", "startTime": "1724310000", "statusCode": "upcoming"}, {"AccountName": "NVSGISRSA.GB", "AffectedResources": "arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:128010802554:db:pdqf1qa1", "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:eu-west-1::event/RDS/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_ff68ef5fa78dd18d71ad094b7f088d03f64b683700cfca15c99c49c439e33105", "awsAccountId": "128010802554", "description": {"latestDescription": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication if resources remain unresolved.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.\n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home"}, "endTime": null, "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-15 06:00:14.321000+02:00", "region": "eu-west-1", "service": "RDS", "startTime": "1724310000", "statusCode": "upcoming"}, {"AccountName": "NVSGISRSA.GB", "AffectedResources": "arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:128010802554:db:unravelmysqlprod01v2", "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:eu-west-1::event/RDS/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_ff68ef5fa78dd18d71ad094b7f088d03f64b683700cfca15c99c49c439e33105", "awsAccountId": "128010802554", "description": {"latestDescription": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication if resources remain unresolved.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.\n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home"}, "endTime": null, "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-15 06:00:14.321000+02:00", "region": "eu-west-1", "service": "RDS", "startTime": "1724310000", "statusCode": "upcoming"}, {"AccountName": "NVSGISRSA.GB", "AffectedResources": "arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:128010802554:db:airflowf1qa01", "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:eu-west-1::event/RDS/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_ff68ef5fa78dd18d71ad094b7f088d03f64b683700cfca15c99c49c439e33105", "awsAccountId": "128010802554", "description": {"latestDescription": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication if resources remain unresolved.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.\n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home"}, "endTime": null, "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-15 06:00:14.321000+02:00", "region": "eu-west-1", "service": "RDS", "startTime": "1724310000", "statusCode": "upcoming"}, {"AccountName": "NVSGISRSA.GB", "AffectedResources": "arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:128010802554:db:airflowf1prd01", "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:eu-west-1::event/RDS/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_ff68ef5fa78dd18d71ad094b7f088d03f64b683700cfca15c99c49c439e33105", "awsAccountId": "128010802554", "description": {"latestDescription": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication if resources remain unresolved.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.\n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1.

To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home"}, "endTime": null, "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-15 06:00:14.321000+02:00", "region": "eu-west-1", "service": "RDS", "startTime": "1724310000", "statusCode": "upcoming"}, {"AccountName": "NVSGISRSB.GB", "AffectedResources": "arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:866919043554:db:artifactoryprod-old", "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:eu-west-1::event/RDS/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_ff68ef5fa78dd18d71ad094b7f088d03f64b683700cfca15c99c49c439e33105", "awsAccountId": "866919043554", "description": {"latestDescription": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication if resources remain unresolved.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.\n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration. If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home"}, "endTime": null, "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-15 06:00:14.321000+02:00", "region": "eu-west-1", "service": "RDS", "startTime": "1724310000", "statusCode": "upcoming"}, {"AccountName": "NVSGISRSB.GB", "AffectedResources": "arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:866919043554:db:dhmcoredev01", "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:eu-west-1::event/RDS/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_ff68ef5fa78dd18d71ad094b7f088d03f64b683700cfca15c99c49c439e33105", "awsAccountId": "866919043554", "description": {"latestDescription": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication if resources remain unresolved.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.\n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire.

Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home"}, "endTime": null, "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-15 06:00:14.321000+02:00", "region": "eu-west-1", "service": "RDS", "startTime": "1724310000", "statusCode": "upcoming"}, {"AccountName": "NVSGISRSB.GB", "AffectedResources": "arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:866919043554:db:f1sepeuiedev01", "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:eu-west-1::event/RDS/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT/AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_ff68ef5fa78dd18d71ad094b7f088d03f64b683700cfca15c99c49c439e33105", "awsAccountId": "866919043554", "description": {"latestDescription": "[AWS Health may periodically trigger reminder notifications about this communication if resources remain unresolved.]\n\nYou are receiving this message because your AWS Account has one or more Amazon RDS, or Amazon Aurora database instances in the EU-WEST-1 Region using a SSL/TLS Certificate that is expiring on August 22, 2024.\n\nA list of your affected resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nThis is a follow-up notification for SSL/TLS CA certification expiration.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the EU-WEST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate.

If you believe you have already finished this work and still received this email, it is likely because you created new instances using the 2019 Certificate Authority (CA). After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1.

After January 25, 2024 all newly created instances that do not explicitly specify a different CA will use the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 CA. For information on setting an account level CA override, see the modify-certificates API documentation [1].\n\nIf your applications connect to these instances using the SSL/TLS protocol, you will need to take action before August 22, 2024 to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances. Even if you do not currently use SSL for your connections, you could still be affected if your databases server certificate expires, so we still recommend updating your CA.\n\nTo protect your communications with your database instances, a CA generates time-bound certificates that are checked by your database client software to authenticate any database instance before exchanging information. Following industry best practices, AWS renews the CA and creates new certificates on a routine basis to ensure customer connections are properly protected for years to come. The current CA in the US-EAST-1 Region will expire on August 22, 2024. Before this date you will need to update your DB server certificate. The following is the general process to do this:\n\nFirst, update your application clients with the new certificate, if your application client is using a trust store then add the new CA certificates into the trust stores of your client applications. RDS provides download links to the CA certificates in our User Guide [2]. For more detailed instructions on updating the trust stores on your client application see our documentation [3].\n\nSecond, update the certificate on all your affected database instances to one of the newly issued CAs. \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 is the default recommended CA because there is no algorithm change. The other CAs use new key algorithms so it could require more testing of your client setup to ensure compatibility. For more information on the new CAs see our documentation [4].\n\nThird, if you want to use a different CA than the default \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019, you will need to set an account level CA override so your new instances will use the CA of your choice. To do this a modify-certificates API is available that will allow you to override the default CA on newly created database instances to either the old or one of the new CAs. This override will only apply while the CA you are overriding to is valid. To use this API you will need to be running the AWS CLI version 1.17 or later. For more information see the modify-certificates API documentation [1]. There is also a describe-certificates API [5], that will indicate your current default CA override if you have one set. To set a specific CA during instance creation use the ca-certificate-identifier option on the create-db-instance API to create a DB instance with a specific CA. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\nFor more detailed instructions on how to perform these updates, please see the Amazon RDS instances [7] and Amazon Aurora instances [8] documentation.\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\n1. As soon as possible - You should update your client trust store, then you can update your instances server certificate to one generated by one of the new CAs.\n\n2. After January 26, 2024 - any new database instances default to using the \u2018rds-ca-rsa2048-g1\u2019 certificate. If you wish for new instances to use a different certificate, you can specify which certificate to use with the AWS console or the AWS CLI. For more information, see the create-db-instance API documentation [6].\n\n3. After August 22, 2024 - \u2018rds-ca-2019\u2019 will expire. You will need to take action before August 22, 2024, to prevent connectivity failures to your existing database instances.\n\nFor more information see our blog [9], and if you have questions or concerns, please contact AWS Support [10].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-certificates.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.CertificatesAllRegions\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating\n[4] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html#UsingWithRDS.SSL.RegionCertificateAuthorities\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-certificates.html\n[6] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html\n[7] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[8] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html\n[9] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/rotate-your-ssl-tls-certificates-now-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora-expire-in-2024/\n[10] https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home"}, "endTime": null, "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_RDS_PLANNED_LIFECYCLE_EVENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-14 05:03:15.535000+02:00", "region": "us-east-1", "service": "RDS", "startTime": "1724310000", "statusCode": "upcoming"}, {"AccountName": "NOVARTIS-RSSR54.PGB", "AffectedResources": ["droid-cluster-tf|droid-drdo", "droid-cluster-tf-pprd-dev|droid-notificationapi-pprd-dev", "droid-cluster-tf-pprd-qa|droid-brmsbgprocess-pprd-qa", "droid-cluster-tf|droid-notificationapi", "droid-cluster-tf-pprd-dev|droid-brmsbgprocess-pprd-dev"], "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/ECS/AWS_ECS_TASK_PATCHING_RETIREMENT/AWS_ECS_TASK_PATCHING_RETIREMENT-IAD-DockerLinux-1-4-0-262-888812608584-MANAGED", "awsAccountId": "888812608584", "description": {"latestDescription": "You are receiving this notification because AWS Fargate has deployed a new platform version revision [1] and will retire any tasks running on previous platform version revision(s) starting at Sat, 20 Jul 2024 03:00 GMT as part of routine task maintenance [2].

Any tasks launched after Sat, 6 Jul 2024 00:00 GMT were launched on the new platform version revision.\n\nAWS Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers. As described in the Fargate documentation [2] and [4], Fargate regularly deploys platform version revisions to make new features available and for routine maintenance. The Fargate update includes the most current Linux kernel and runtime components. Fargate will gradually replace the tasks in your service using your configured deployment settings, ensuring all tasks run on the new Fargate platform version revision.\n\nWe do not expect this update to impact your ECS services. However, if you want to control when your tasks are replaced, you can initiate an ECS service update before Sat, 13 Jul 2024 00:00 GMT by following the instructions below.\n\nIf you are using the rolling deployment type for your service, you can run the update-service command from the AWS command-line interface specifying force-new-deployment:\n\n$ aws ecs update-service --service service_name \\\n--cluster cluster_name --force-new-deployment\n\nIf you are using the Blue/Green deployment type, please refer to the documentation for create-deployment [5] and create a new deployment using the same task definition version.\n\nPlease contact AWS Support [6] if you have any questions or concerns.\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/AWS_Fargate-versions.html\n[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/task-maintenance.html\n[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service_definition_parameters.html#sd-deploymentconfiguration\n[4] https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/improving-operational-visibility-with-aws-fargate-task-retirement-notifications/\n[5] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/create-deployment.html\n[6] https://aws.amazon.com/support\n\n"}, "endTime": "1721433600", "eventTypeCategory": "scheduledChange", "eventTypeCode": "AWS_ECS_TASK_PATCHING_RETIREMENT", "lastUpdatedTime": "2024-07-06 02:17:21.695000+02:00", "region": "eu-west-1", "service": "ECS", "startTime": "1720828800", "statusCode": "open"}, {"AccountName": "NVSGISRSA.GB", "AffectedResources": "i-0b4ac11d706726fd8", "ClarityID": "045879", "arn": "arn:aws:health:eu-west-1::event/EC2/AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_STOP_SCHEDULED/AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_STOP_SCHEDULED_93e9a26c-5427-41f1-9fef-7bf199cdb20b", "awsAccountId": "128010802554", "description": {"latestDescription": "One or more of your Amazon EC2 instances, located in the eu-west-1 region, are scheduled for maintenance that requires your instances to be retired on 2024-07-19.

Please note that any data on local instance-store volumes will not be preserved when you stop and start your instance. For more information about stopping and starting your instance, and what to expect when your instance is stopped, such as the effect on public, private and Elastic IP addresses associated with your instance, see Stop and Start Your Instance in the EC2 User Guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html. \n\n* Why does my instance require maintenance?\n\nEC2 routinely performs maintenance on the underlying systems in order to strengthen the security, reliability and operational performance of the EC2 service for our customers.

Per the Aurora Version Policy [1], we are providing advance notice to give you time to upgrade your database cluster(s). We recommend that you proactively upgrade your databases running Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL major version 12.x to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 13 or higher at your convenience before February 28, 2025. We will send you updates and reminders prior to the end of support deadline.\n\nStarting on or after February 28, 2025, if you do not upgrade your database running Aurora PostgreSQL 12.x to a newer major version that is Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 13 or higher or if you are not on Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 12.9 long-term-support version (LTS), Amazon Aurora will upgrade your Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 12.x databases to the appropriate Extended Support minor version during a scheduled maintenance window.  Extended Support charges will start on March 1, 2025 regardless of what 12.x version your database is running. You do not have to use the AWS console or APIs to opt-in to Amazon RDS Extended Support manually and you can continue to run 12.x databases on Extended Support for up to three years. Extended Support charges will continue until you upgrade to a newer major version.\n\n\n- How to Determine Which Instances are Running Aurora PostgreSQL 12.x\nIn the Amazon RDS console, you can see details about a database cluster, including the Aurora PostgreSQL version of instances in the cluster, by choosing Databases from the console's navigation pane. To view DB cluster information by using the AWS CLI, use the describe-db-clusters command. To view DB cluster information using the Amazon RDS API, use the DescribeDBClusters operation. [2] You can also query a database directly to get the version number by querying the aurora_version() system function i.e., \"SELECT * FROM aurora_version();\".\n\n\n\n- How to Upgrade to a New Major Version \nYou can initiate an upgrade of your database instance either immediately or during your next maintenance window to a newer major version of Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL using the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). The upgrade process will shut down the database instance, perform the upgrade, and restart the database instance. The database instance may be restarted multiple times during the upgrade process. While major version upgrades typically complete within the standard maintenance window, the duration of the upgrade depends on the number of objects within the database. To avoid any unplanned unavailability outside your maintenance window, we recommend that you first take a snapshot [3] or a fast database clone [4] of your database and test the upgrade to get an estimate of the duration. To learn more about upgrading PostgreSQL major versions in Aurora, review the Upgrading Database Versions page [5].  \n\n\n\n- Availability of Extended Support\nAmazon RDS Extended Support [6] allows you to continue to use Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition major versions after the community end-of-life. During this time, AWS provides fixes for critical security issues and bugs through patch releases, giving you more time, up to three years, to upgrade to a new major version to help you meet your business requirements. For provisioned instances on Amazon Aurora, Amazon RDS Extended Support is priced per vCPU per hour [7]. \n\n\nPlease be aware of the following timeline:\n\nA. Now through February 28, 2025 - You can initiate upgrades of Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 12.x instances to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 13 or higher at any time.\n\nB.

Starting on June 12, 2024, Lambda will no longer apply security patches and other updates to the Node.js 16 runtime used by Lambda functions, and functions using Node.js 16 will no longer be eligible for technical support. Also, Node.js 16 will no longer be available in the AWS Console, although you can still create and update functions that use Node.js 16 via AWS CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, AWS SAM, or other tools.

Starting March 31, 2025, you will no longer be able to update existing functions using the Node.js 16 runtime.\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your existing Node.js 16 functions to the latest available Node.js runtime before June 12, 2024. A list of your Node.js 16 functions can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab of the AWS Health Dashboard.\n\nEnd of support does not impact function execution. Your functions will continue to run. However, they will be running on an unsupported runtime which is no longer maintained or patched by the AWS Lambda team.\n\nThis notification is generated for functions using the Node.js 16 runtime for the $LATEST function version. The following command shows how to use the AWS CLI [3] to list all functions in a specific region using Node.js 16, including published function versions. To find all such functions in your account, repeat this command for each region:\n\naws lambda list-functions --region us-west-2 --output text --query \"Functions[?Runtime=='nodejs16.x'].FunctionArn\"\n\nFrom 180 days before deprecation, you can also use Trusted Advisor to identify all functions using the Node.js 16 runtime, including published
